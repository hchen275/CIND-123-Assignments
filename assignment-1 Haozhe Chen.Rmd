## Instructions 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. Review this website for more details on using R Markdown <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Use RStudio for this assignment. Complete the assignment by inserting your R code wherever you see the string "#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE".

When you click the **Knit** button, a document (PDF, Word, or HTML format) will be generated that includes both the assignment content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks.

Submit **both**  the rmd and generated output files. Failing to submit both files will be subject to mark deduction.

## Sample Question and Solution

Use `seq()` to create the vector $(1,2,3,\ldots,10)$.

```{r}
seq(1,10)
```

## Question 1

a) Use the `seq()` function to create the vector $(1, 7, 13, \ldots, 61)$. Note that each term in this sequence is of the form 
$1 + 6n$ where $n = 0, \ldots, 10$.

```{r}
seq(1, 61, by=6)
```

b) Use `rep()` to create the vector $(2,3,4,\dots,2,3,4, \dots,2,3,4)$ in which the sequence $(2,3,4)$ is repeated 5 times.

```{r}
rep(2:4, 5)
```

c) To convert factor to number, would it be correct to use the following commands? Explain your answer.

`factorVar <- factor(c(1, 6, 5.4, 3.2));as.numeric(factorVar)`

```{r}
#No. When using "as.numeric" command to convert a factor, R will automatically assign numbers to the categories of the factor. Therefore, it is necessary to first convert a factor to character and then to numeric. The right command should be:

factorVar <- factor(c(1, 6, 5.4, 3.2))
as.numeric(as.character(factorVar))
```

d) A comma-separated values file `dataset.csv` consists of missing values represented by question marks (`?`) and exclamation mark (`!`). How can you read this type of files in R?

```{r}
#We can replace the missing values represented by "?" or "!" with a value that can be treated or excluded later. For example, we can use the command is.na(dataset) to detect any missing data in the dataset and then assign them to a value such as 0. 
```

\newpage
## Question 2

a) Compute: $$\sum_{n=10}^{100} n^3$$

```{r}
sum((10:100)^3)
```

b) Compute: $$\sum_{n=1}^{10}\left(\frac{2^{n}}{n^2} + \frac{n^{4}}{4^{n}}\right)$$

```{r}
n <- 1:10
sum(((2^n)/(n^2))+((n^4)/(4^n)))
```

c) Compute: $$\sum_{n=0}^{10} \frac{1}{(n+1)!}$$ 

```{r}
m <- 0:10
sum(1/factorial(m+1))
```

d) Compute: $$\prod_{n=3}^{33} \left(3n + \frac{3}{\sqrt[3]{n}}\right)$$

```{r}
a <- 3:33
prod((3*a)+(3/(a^(1/3))))
```

e) Explain the output of this R-command:
`c(0:5)[NA]`

```{r}
c(0:5)[NA]  
#c(0;5)[x] means to extract the xth number in the vector; NA means unknown or missingness, and is not a valid index in R, as an index must be an integer. As such, the above command returns as: 
```

f) What is the difference between is.vector() and is.numeric() functions?

```{r}
#"is.vector" is used to verify is the object between the brackets is stored as a vector by R. The result is either "True" (indicating the object is a vector) or "False" (indicating the contrary). 

#"is.numeric" is used to verify is the object between the brackets is stored as a number by R. The result is either "True" or "False". 
```

g) List at least three advantages and three disadvantages of using `RShiny` package?
```{r}
#Advantage 1: RShiny has an extensive gallary for data visualization; therefore, it is an excellent tool to visualize complex datasets. 

#Advantage 2: RShiny is excellent for building interactive data visualizations by itself. As such, no HTML, Javascript or CSS knowledge is required for the purposes of customizing datasets and user interface. 

#Advantage 3: RShiny can be automated to perform a set of operations 

#Disadvantage 1: In order to use RShiny, one will need to learn the R language, while other software programs such as Tableau have a much flat learning curve with coding mostly reserved for advanced users. 

#Disadvantage 2: Becasue RShiny is open sourced, there is no way to block someone from accessing the app once it is hosted online. 

#Disadvantage 3: The free version only allows for 25 active hours of app running time per month. You will need to pay to get unlimited access. 
```

## Question 3
`iris` dataset gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

Install the `iris` dataset on your computer using the command `install.packages("datasets")`. Then, load the `datasets` package into your session using the following command.
```{r}
library(datasets)
```

a) Display the first six rows of the `iris` data set.

```{r}
head(iris)
```

b) Compute the average of the first four variables (Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length and Petal.Width) using `sapply()` function.

Hint: You might need to consider removing the `NA` values, otherwise the average will not be computed.

```{r}
sapply(iris[1:4] ,mean ,rm = NA )
```

c) Show how to use R to replace the missing values in this dataset with plausible ones.

```{r}
iris[is.na(iris)] <- 0
```

d) Compute the standard deviation for only the first and the third variables (Sepal.Length and Petal.Length)

```{r}
sd(iris [,1] )
```
```{r}
sd(iris [,3] )
```

e) Construct a boxplot for `Sepal.Width` variable, then display the values of all the outliers. Explain how these outliers have been calculated.

```{r}
boxplot(iris$Sepal.Width, ylab="Sepal.Width", main = "Boxplot Distribution of Sepal Width")

#Outliners are data points that fall below the lower fence or above the upper fence. The lower fence is calculated as Q1-1.5*IQR, and the upper fence is calculated as Q3+1.5*IQR.
```

f) Compute the upper quartile of the `Sepal.Width` variable with two different methods.

```{r}
#Method 1
summary(iris$Sepal.Width)
```
```{r}
#Method 2
quantile(iris$Sepal.Width, 0.75)
```

g) Construct a pie chart to describe the species with 'Sepal.Length' less than 7 centimeters.
```{r}
lessthan7 <- subset(iris, iris$Sepal.Length < 7)
species <- table(lessthan7$Species)
pie(species)
```

END of Assignment #1.
